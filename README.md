# Summary

![generated](assets/images/genereated-screenshot.png)

Ye Ole Book o' GIFs is a gif generator that allows a user to generate random GIFs of their choosing by first adding the keyword they'd like to search for and then clicking on the button that dynamically generates when they search.  The GIFs are then displayed in an organized fashion against an 'open book' backdrop to mimic the opening of the 'closed book' backdrop that first appears when the page is loaded.

## Technology

The gif generator's logic is composed of primarily jQuery with a few vanilla javascript components also implemented. Only one HTML file is referenced, and the styling is a mix of internal CSS, Bootstrap, Google Fonts and Animate.css.

## Current State

The generator is fully functional and displays well, but could use a bit of clean-up as far as mobile responsiveness.
